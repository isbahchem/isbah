      <h3>Top Five programming languages to learn in 2023</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
        In 2023, the following programming languages are considered popular and
        in-demand: </p> 
        <p>1. Python: Python continues to be one of the most widely used
        programming languages due to its simplicity, versatility, and extensive
        libraries. It is commonly used for web development, data analysis,
        machine learning, and automation.</p>
        <p> 2. JavaScript: JavaScript is the
        backbone of web development and is essential for creating interactive
        and dynamic websites. With the rise of frameworks like React and
        Angular, JavaScript has become even more important in front-end and
        full-stack development.</p>
        <p> 3. Go: Go, also known as Golang, has gained
        popularity for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for
        concurrent programming. It is widely used for building scalable and
        high-performance systems, especially in cloud computing and network
        programming.</p>
        <p> 4. Rust: Rust has gained attention for its focus on memory
        safety, performance, and concurrency. It is often used for systems
        programming, where low-level control and high performance are crucial,
        such as in operating systems, game engines, and embedded systems.</p>
        <p> 5.
        Kotlin: Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java
        Virtual Machine (JVM) and is fully interoperable with Java. It has
        gained popularity for Android app development due to its concise syntax,
        null safety, and enhanced productivity features.</p>
        <p> While these five
        languages are currently trending, it's important to note that the choice
        of programming language depends on your specific goals, interests, and
        the industry you're targeting.</p>
